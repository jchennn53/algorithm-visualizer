# Algorithm Visualizer

A web application for algorithm visualization, built with React and d3.js. This interactive tool provides a comprehensive platform for understanding algorithms through visual representation and step-by-step execution.

## Overview

This project offers an intuitive interface for exploring various sorting algorithms, with planned support for graph algorithms. It serves as both an educational tool and a technical demonstration of algorithm implementation.

### Current features

- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms
- Interactive step-by-step execution control
- Custom array input and random array generation
- Adjustable visualization speed
- Supported algorithms:
  - Bubble sort
  - Quick sort
  - Selection sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Merge sort

### Technical stack

- Frontend: React.js with d3.js for visualizations
- Backend: Express.js

## Getting started

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jchennn53/algorithm-visualizer
cd algorithm-visualizer
npm install
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Development roadmap
